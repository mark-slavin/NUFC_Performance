# NUFC_Performance
Excel based analysis on the performance of Newcastle United against the previous 5 seasons.

It all started with a query to Google's Gemini LLM
I told it which columns I wanted and after a to and frow, when it only game me eight games per season so I had to ask it for all of the games (it applogised).

I was presented with the results for each season in seperate tables.
